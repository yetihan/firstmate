# `.claude/skills/firstmate-calm` path the project auto-loads it from, then its own
# `claude plugin test` suites (tests/*.test.ts inside the mod), which run the hooks
# module in the engine's own host against a mocked clock, environment, file system,
# and drawing surface. No model turn is submitted and no credential is spent, so the
# guard runs by default wherever `claude` is installed; the portable checks that need
# no Claude Code binary live in tests/fm-calm-claude-mod.test.sh.

# The early-access function-hooks surface is default-off; the flag is set on this
# test's own processes only and never written into any settings file.
