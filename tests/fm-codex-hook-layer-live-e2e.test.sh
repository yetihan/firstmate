# Live guard for the codex crewmate launch's hook posture.
#
# The verdict here comes from the installed codex, not from a stub: a stub can
# only confirm the assumption already written into it, and what this guard
# protects is exactly a vendor-owned surface. Codex blocks a fresh crewmate
# launch on an unanswerable "Hooks need review" modal whenever the machine's
# ~/.codex/hooks.json or a project's .codex/hooks.json carries a hook it has no
# persisted trust for, so the crewmate launch disables codex's hook layer
# outright (bin/fm-spawn.sh's launch template owns the flag).
#
# The guard replays the REAL launch flags fm-spawn builds - captured from a
# spawn driven through a fake pane - against the installed codex and asks codex
# itself whether hooks ended up disabled. If a codex release renames or drops
# the feature, the flag becomes a hard "Unknown feature flag" error and this
# guard fails naming the harness and version instead of letting the modal
# silently come back.
#
# It spends no model tokens (`codex features list` resolves configuration only),
# so it runs by default wherever codex is installed.
