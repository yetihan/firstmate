// Firstmate's Calm-only animated working presentation for Pi.
//
// Calm replaces Pi's stock working row with a tiny SSHHIP-derived boat while one
// logical agent run is active. The sprite geometry, bounce track, two animation
// cadences, palette classes, and freeze/resume state are owned by the harness-neutral
// ./fm-calm-working-ship-sprite.ts (a tracked symlink into the Claude Code Calm mod,
// which both harnesses share); this module owns only Pi's rendering of those frames
// as standard ANSI escapes and the temporary TUI widget. `.pi/extensions/fm-calm.ts`
// owns when the presentation is installed and removed, and stays the sole caller of
// setWorkingVisible(). docs/calm.md owns the captain-facing contract.
//
// Continuity: one extension-owned animation instance survives hide/show within the same
// Pi process and Calm extension lifetime. Disposing the widget freezes column,
// direction, water phase, and tick cadence without advancing them for hidden wall
// time. The next working period resumes from that exact logical state. A fresh session
// or new extension lifetime calls reset() and starts at the normal initial position.
// State is never a module-level or process-global singleton.
//
// Verified against Pi 0.81.1 declarations and the Pi 0.82.0 CLI, which expose
// ExtensionUIContext.setWidget() with a component factory, per-widget dispose(), and
// TUI.requestRender(). Pi renders a widget through Component.render(width), so this
// module recomputes its track from that width on every frame instead of caching a
// terminal size that a resize would invalidate. A resize while the boat is hidden is
// applied on the first resumed frame through the same clamp path.
