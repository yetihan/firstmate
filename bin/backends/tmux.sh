# bin/backends/tmux.sh - the tmux session-provider adapter.
#
# Reference backend (AGENTS.md section 8; data/fm-backend-design-d7). P1 moves
# the tmux command sequences that fm-send.sh, fm-peek.sh, fm-watch.sh,
# fm-spawn.sh, and fm-teardown.sh already ran inline into named functions
# here, running the EXACT same commands in the EXACT same order, so the
# default (tmux, `backend=` absent) path stays byte-identical. Sourced only
# through bin/fm-backend.sh's fm_backend_source, never directly.
#
# Worktree acquisition (running `treehouse get` inside the pane, and polling
# its cwd) is unchanged by this extraction: P1 scopes only the session
# provider, not the worktree provider, so fm-spawn.sh still drives that part
# inline with these same send/current-path primitives.
#
# The verified composer/busy-detection and verify-and-retry-submit primitives
# already live in bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh, shared with the away-mode daemon
# (bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh); this adapter sources that file and re-exports
# its submit core under the backend's naming convention rather than
# duplicating it, so the two consumers cannot drift apart.

# Robustness (fm-spawn tmux window handling under a non-default captain config):

#     ("$ses:"), so a non-default base-index (e.g. base-index 1) cannot collide.
#   - PIN the window name by disabling automatic-rename and allow-rename on the
#     new window: the captain's tmux may rename the window away from fm-<id> once
#     treehouse cd's into the worktree, which would break name-based targeting.
# The returned window id lets callers target the window even if its name is ever

# fm_backend_tmux_foreground_comms: the kernel-side names of every process in
# <target>'s pane tty foreground process group, one full value per line.
# Empty on any failure.
#
# This is the foreground-process-group half of the liveness probe, and it exists
# because `#{pane_current_command}` and `ps -o comm=` expose different name
# fields whose roles vary by platform. On macOS the tmux field can carry a
# harness-rewritten title (Claude Code 2.1.220 reports `2.1.220`) while `comm`
# retains executable identity; the portable Linux regression observes the
# reverse for its version-named executable. Reading both `comm` and argv[0]
# preserves an identifying install path without making either platform's field
# assignment load-bearing.
#
# Scoping to the foreground process group rather than to the pane's descendants
# is what keeps the probe honest in the other direction: a harness-named process
# left running in the background of an otherwise idle pane is deliberately NOT
# reported, so a genuinely agent-free pane still classifies `dead`. It also
# reports every member of a multi-process launcher (the Pi Launcher path runs a
# `pi-signed` wrapper and a `pi` engine in one group), so no launcher needs its
# own special case here.
#
# Like fm_backend_tmux_current_command this is a RAW pane read: tmux answers an
# absent target from the client's active window rather than failing, so callers
# must confirm exact window membership first, exactly as the classifier below
# does, or they will describe some other pane entirely.

# recorded target. See bin/fm-backend.sh's fm_backend_agent_state for the
# shared state vocabulary and docs/tmux-backend.md "Agent liveness probe" for
# the empirical basis. Tmux silently falls back to the active window when a
# named target is absent, so the exact recorded window must appear in a
# successful session inventory before its foreground command can be trusted.
# An omitted window or a definitive missing-session/server response is
# `missing`; any other inventory or pane read failure is `unreadable`, so a
# transient tmux problem never licenses a duplicate.
# fm_backend_tmux_window_inventory above owns that read classification, shared

# a false `dead` is the one outcome that can launch a duplicate agent onto a
# live worktree, while the foreground process group - when it is readable - is
# authoritative for the negative verdicts, since it is the only source that can
# distinguish a truly idle pane from a rewritten process title. A pane kept
# present by remain-on-exit after its process exited still reports that
# process's retained title, so pane death retires the title source entirely:
# no live foreground group named a harness, and the endpoint is confidently
# `dead` rather than an immortal title ghost.
