# Merge a task's PR or MR after recording pr= and any available pr_head= through
# bin/fm-pr-check.sh, so teardown can verify landed work after squash merges.
# The full canonical URL is parsed by bin/fm-pr-lib.sh. A GitHub pull request is
# addressed through gh by the derived owner and repository; a GitLab merge
# request is addressed through glab by the project URL rebuilt from the parsed
# host and path, so any instance works and no host is hardcoded.
#
# Merge method on GitHub defaults to --squash when the caller passes none of
# --squash, --merge, --rebase, or --method after the optional -- separator.
# A GitHub merge is refused unless every pre-merge condition holds, each read
# live at merge time rather than taken from recorded metadata: the pull request
# is open, not a draft, mergeable, free of conflicts, and every unwaived check
# is green at the exact current head commit, where github_checks_not_green below
# owns what makes a check green and judges each one by its current run.
# Every failing condition is reported, not
# just the first. The verified head is then passed to gh as
# --match-head-commit, so a push that lands between that read and the merge
# fails the merge instead of landing commits nothing verified. Reading that
# state needs gh and jq, and either one absent stops the merge before any
# state is recorded. An attended --allow-red <check-name> may be passed once,
# with the name as a separate argument; it waives only checks with that exact
# name, still requires every other check green, and still binds the head. It is
# refused while the away-posture record exists, and it never
# applies on GitLab, where the head-pipeline check is waived only for a proven
# no-CI project or by the attended-only --no-ci flag. After gh returns success,
# GitHub's live state is read back and accepted only when the pull request is
# merged or in the merge queue. gh's
# GraphQL API supplies that queue-aware read; when that read fails, gh-axi's
# own view still proves a landed merge, and every outcome it cannot prove
# refuses, reporting the failed gh read and naming both failed reads when the
# gh-axi view could not prove the outcome either.
# If the pull request remains open and the base branch has an effective
# merge_queue rule, an attended refusal names the queue's configured merge
# method and exact --attended-override -- --auto --<method> retry flags. While
# the away-posture record exists, asynchronous merge requests are refused and
# queue retry flags are not offered because they would outlive away authority.
# An attended caller that already passed the configured method with --auto is
# told instead that the accepted request has not entered the queue and its queue
# state has to be re-checked.
# No method is selected for the caller in any case. A rules response that names
# no queue rule, one that could not be read, rules that disagree, and a method
# this script does not recognise are four distinct outcomes and are reported
# apart, because each one leaves the operator somewhere different.
# A caller-requested --auto that leaves the pull request neither merged nor
# queued is refused the same way and says auto-merge was armed with nothing
# landed or queued yet, or, when the merge command itself failed, that auto-merge
# was only requested; both are read from the caller's own arguments rather than
# from the forge's prose.
# Every refusal that follows a merge command which returned success quotes that
# command's own output, marked as the forge's text and kept apart from this
# script's verdict, including the refusal for an outcome that cannot be read;
# a merge command that failed keeps its original error surfaced raw and first.
# GitLab adds no method flag at all: its merge method is the project's own
# setting, which the merge API applies, and imposing squash there would override
# that convention rather than mirror the GitHub default.
#
# A GitLab merge is refused unless every pre-merge condition holds, each read
# live at merge time rather than taken from recorded metadata: the merge request
# is open, detailed_merge_status is mergeable, has_conflicts is false, and
# blocking_discussions_resolved is true. Every failing condition is reported,
# not just the first. The fifth condition is the head pipeline, and it has
# three states instead of two. A pipeline that succeeded at the exact current
# head commit satisfies it as before. A project that genuinely has no CI
# configuration can never produce a head pipeline, so treating an empty pipeline
# the same as a failed one refuses every merge request on such a project
# forever; when the pipeline check fails, gitlab_project_has_no_ci therefore
# proves the absence from GitLab's own read-only project and repository APIs
# (the project's ci_config_path setting, the referenced file's existence at the
# verified head, or CI/CD disabled outright) before the pipeline conditions are
# waived, and the verified line records the waiver and its basis so the exempt
# merge stays auditable. An empty pipeline on a project that does have CI
# configuration - skipped, deleted, or never run - proves nothing and still
# refuses. An explicit --no-ci flag waives the pipeline conditions without the
# probe; it is operator intent, never an implicit fallback, it is refused while
# the away-posture record exists exactly like --allow-red, and it applies only
# to GitLab. The verified head is then passed to glab as --sha, so a push that
# lands between that read and the merge fails the merge instead of landing
# commits nothing verified. A recorded pr_head that disagrees with the live head
# is reported rather than trusted, because a rebase moves the head and leaves
# the recorded value stale. Reading that state needs glab and jq, and either one
# absent stops the merge before any state is recorded.
#
# Before either forge merge, the task's existing per-task control lock
# serializes the captain-hold check through the forge command. A still-held or
# unreadable row refuses before that command, so a captain approval must be
# recorded as an `answer --release` before this entrypoint is invoked. While
# state/.afk-contract exists, a merge for this task also proceeds only if its
# meta yolo=on or its id is in that record's merge-grant list; otherwise it is
# held for the captain return. An unreadable record refuses rather than being
# skipped. Neither posture releases a captain hold, and the grant lapses when
# the record is archived.
# The authority read and synchronous forge command share the away record's
# cross-subsystem lock, which bin/fm-afk-contract.sh owns, closing the common
# live-owner TOCTOU; failure to take it refuses before the forge call. Async and
# queued paths are refused while away. Two confused-agent-grade limitations are
# accepted rather than hidden: queue or base changes after GitHub's preflight can
# still enqueue, and killing this shell can orphan a forge child after stale-lock
# recovery. docs/architecture.md owns those away-merge limits, while
# docs/captain-hold-lifecycle.md owns the separate merge-to-cleanup residual.
# A failed forge command releases the lock after it returns. A successful one
# retains the lock until the accepted merge authority is persisted against the
# still-matching task metadata.
#
# Extra args must not include --repo or -R in any form, including a bundled
# short-option cluster such as -yR, because the repository comes only from the
# URL, nor --sha or --match-head-commit because the head comes only from the
# live read. An existing task-meta pr= must equal the requested canonical URL;
# a task cannot be rebound here. Auto-merge (--auto), a protection bypass
# (--admin), and branch
# deletion (--delete-branch, -d and short-flag clusters, and GitLab's
# --remove-source-branch) are refused by default; --attended-override, parsed
# before the optional -- separator, re-enables those forge flags for an
# explicit captain instruction and never skips the live green check, the
# away-grant check, or a captain hold.
#
# Usage: fm-pr-merge.sh <task-id> <pr-url> [--attended-override] [--allow-red <check-name>] [--no-ci] [-- <extra forge merge args>]
#
# On GitLab, this script confirms the MR is actually merged before reporting it;
# an auto-merge-queued or unconfirmed request leaves the poll armed and records
# no landed outcome. bin/fm-merge-outcome-lib.sh owns a confirmed merge's
# destination, normal-case deduplication, and at-least-once recovery.
# A landed merge whose outcome cannot be written is reported loudly rather than
# misreported as a failed merge.

# Every GitHub check that is not green in the given live pull-request JSON, one
# name per line. An entry is green when it is a status context whose state is
# SUCCESS, or a check run that completed with SUCCESS, NEUTRAL, or SKIPPED (so
# a pending check is not green either). Exits nonzero when the rollup cannot be
# read, so a malformed answer is a failed read and never an empty red set.
#
# The rollup can hold several runs of one check name at the same head, because
# GitHub cancels a pull request's in-flight run when the base branch advances
# and re-triggers it; the cancelled run stays in the rollup beside the passing
# re-run. A check is therefore judged by its current run rather than by any run
# that a later one superseded, which is what makes this agree with GitHub's own
# CLEAN mergeStateStatus instead of refusing a pull request GitHub considers
# mergeable.
#
# Supersession applies only among check runs with the same reported name. A
# name is dropped from the red set only when every non-green run is COMPLETED,
# has a whole-second UTC startedAt, and started strictly before a green run.
# Status contexts are never grouped or superseded, and every non-green one is
# reported independently. A still-running, queued, undated, or tied check run
# stays red. A name whose runs are all green needs no timestamp, while a name
# with no green run stays red.
#
# The reported name is also what --allow-red matches. An unnamed check run is
# grouped alone and can neither supersede nor be superseded, because unrelated
# unnamed checks must not be treated as one.
