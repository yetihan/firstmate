# ONE owner for the no-mistakes run-attribution primitives used by
# fm-crew-state.sh (read-only current-state reporting) and fm-teardown.sh
# (pre-teardown run abort, see its "Fix 1" header comment). Teardown uses only
# strict branch-and-head identity; crew-state additionally permits the active
# pipeline-owned attribution paths defined below. Getting this wrong in either
# direction is unsafe: a false negative hides a genuinely parked run, and a
# false positive lets teardown act on a run it does not own.

# "<status> <branch> <short-sha> <date> [<pr-url>]"; the `axi` surface has no
# runs-listing subcommand - verified against the installed CLI). Prints the
# status word of the branch's CURRENT run row, or nothing when the ledger
# cannot prove attribution. The branch's NEWEST row alone decides; older rows
# are history and never answer for the present:
#   - newest row's head resolves and matches the worktree (fm_nm_head_matches_worktree):
#     its status word
#   - newest row's head resolves but does not match: nothing (a newer run that

#     unbroken run sequence from a run that ended at the submitted head to an
#     active run on the same branch - the anchored active row's status word is
#     printed. Anything else (no anchor row, an anchor that is merely an
#     ancestor, a terminal unresolvable row) prints nothing, so branch-name
#     coincidence, arbitrary remote state, and other tasks' runs never match.
