# Shared no-mistakes axi run attribution primitives.
#
# ONE owner for the no-mistakes run-attribution primitives used by
# fm-crew-state.sh (read-only current-state reporting) and fm-teardown.sh
# (pre-teardown run abort, see its "Fix 1" header comment). Both bind a run
# by strict branch-and-head identity first, and both then recognize a provable
# pipeline-owned continuation through fm_nm_runs_status_for_worktree below:
# crew-state for an ACTIVE run, so a fix round never reads as an older failed
# run, and teardown for a run PARKED at a gate, so cleanup concludes it
# instead of orphaning it. Getting this wrong in either
# direction is unsafe: a false negative hides a genuinely parked run, and a
# false positive lets teardown act on a run it does not own.
#
# Bounded call to `no-mistakes "$@"` in dir $1, timeout $2 seconds. The bounded

# the ancestor rule (observed 2026-08: a crashed validation daemon left a failed
# run at the worktree's own commit while the live run that replaced it validated
# a descendant commit on the same branch).
