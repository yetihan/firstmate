# Remote-secondmate reply adapter for the generic process-event runner.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-procevent-remote-reply.sh arm <secondmate-id>
#   fm-procevent-remote-reply.sh handle <secondmate-id> <sequence> <result-file>
#   fm-procevent-remote-reply.sh autohandle <source-id> <sequence> <result-file>
#   fm-procevent-remote-reply.sh classify <result-file>
#   fm-procevent-remote-reply.sh terminal <result-file>
#   fm-procevent-remote-reply.sh self-announcing
#   fm-procevent-remote-reply.sh source-id <secondmate-id>
#   fm-procevent-remote-reply.sh retire <secondmate-id>
#
# `arm` registers one blocking, non-destructive delta source for the remote
# home's state/parent-replies.status log. The process-event runner owns blocking,
# capture, publication, and one machine-wide source owner. Each captured delta is
# terminal for that exact registration; `handle` validates and idempotently
# ingests it, acknowledges the captured generation, then registers the next
# cursor-anchored source. A continuity break is escalated and not re-armed.
#
# `autohandle` is the runner's own entry into that same `handle`: it takes the
# canonical source id instead of the secondmate id and is called by the runner
# right after capture, so applying a reply never depends on a handler
# remembering to run it. Ingesting a delta carries no judgement, so it belongs
# in code.
#
# `self-announcing` declares this adapter's one-announcement contract to the
# runner: every byte autohandle applies lands in the parent's state/<id>.status
# stream, whose ordinary signal-scan announcement is durable, so a fully
# autohandled capture needs - and gets - no `check` wake of its own. One remote
# note therefore produces exactly one firstmate wake, through the same signal
# classification a local secondmate's own status append gets, and a replayed
# capture whose source lines are already recorded adds no bytes and stays
# completely quiet. Only a capture autohandle could NOT
# fully apply is published as a `check` wake for the manual handler, and
# running `handle` on that wake is idempotent.
#
# This channel is a status-stream MIRROR, not a correlated-reply channel. A local
# secondmate appends its whole status stream straight into the parent's
# state/<id>.status, and every parent consumer - the open-decision fold, wake
# classification, crew-state reconciliation, and pending-reply resolution - reads
# that one stream. A remote secondmate must present the same model, so ingest
# deduplicates content-bearing lines by normalized source identity, omits blank
# separators, and leaves every semantic judgement to those same shared consumers.
# Correlation is
# a per-line property that fm-pending-reply-lib.sh consumes; it is never a gate
# on the stream. Gating on it here made a remote mate's own progress lines and
# newly raised decisions - which carry no corr= by contract - unrepresentable,
# and rejecting one line failed the whole delta, so the cursor could never
# advance past it. No single line can stop or wedge the stream.
#
# What remains here is only what crossing a machine boundary genuinely adds:
#   - cursor continuity and identity (offset plus prefix digest)
#   - documents a line explicitly OFFERS through a structured `report=data/....md`
#     pointer, fetched through the path-confined remote file reader and rewritten
#     to their local copies, because the parent cannot read the remote filesystem
#   - source-line replay deduplication, because a captured generation can be replayed
#   - control-byte normalization, so content-bearing bytes from another machine
#     cannot make the parent's status file unsafe to read
#   - the caught-up watermark this channel publishes for
#     bin/fm-pending-reply-lib.sh, because a report that exists remotely but has
#     not been mirrored yet must not be mistaken for a report the mate never
#     wrote (see WINDOW_CLOSED_EMPTY below)
# Line framing and size bounding belong to bin/fm-remote-delta-read.sh, which
# delivers only whole lines and breaks continuity on an over-long one.

# Only an explicit structured pointer OFFERS a document. `report=data/....md` is
# the tag a home's own ledger publisher emits for a report it has already
# confirmed exists (bin/fm-inactive-reconcile.sh), and a bracketed
# `[report=data/....md]` form reads identically. A bare path inside prose is a
# mention, not an offer: fetching every mention made a mate's sentence about a
# report it had not written yet trigger a transfer it never offered.
#
# One boundary-valid recognition serves both extraction and rewriting, so the two
# can never disagree about what counts as a pointer. A pointer must start and end
# at a token boundary: `child-report=` is not this tag, and
# `report=data/x.md.bak` offers nothing, not even its `data/x.md` prefix. Each
# line is scanned behind a sentinel byte that normalized payload can never
# contain, so every candidate needs a real preceding boundary character. A
# rejected candidate therefore cannot make the text after it look like the start
# of a line, while adjacent pointers each keep their own boundary.
#
# The rewrite map arrives through a FILE, never the process environment. A delta
# may carry many delivered pointers, and an expanded map can exceed the platform's
# exec argument limit; awk would then fail to start, and a caller that did not
# check would append the empty result as a blank line and advance the cursor past
# dropped status content. Every caller checks the exit status.
