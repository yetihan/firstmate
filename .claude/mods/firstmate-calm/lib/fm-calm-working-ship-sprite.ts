// Firstmate's harness-neutral Calm working-ship sprite.
//
// This module owns the sprite geometry, the bounce track, the two linked animation
// cadences, and the freeze/resume state that every Calm working presentation shares.
// It paints each frame as rows of color-tagged runs and never as bytes, so each harness
// renders the same picture its own way: `.pi/extensions/lib/fm-calm-working-ship.ts`
// paints the runs as standard ANSI escapes for Pi's widget, and `./fm-calm-ship-raster.ts`
// packs them as Claude Code Raster cells. docs/calm.md owns the captain-facing contract
// and docs/calm-mode-feasibility.md the geometry rationale.
//
// It lives inside the Claude Code plugin folder because Claude Code 2.1.272 refuses a
// hooks-module import from outside that folder, symlinks included; the Pi extension
// reaches it through the tracked `.pi/extensions/lib/fm-calm-working-ship-sprite.ts`
// symlink. Nothing here imports a harness: every glyph is one terminal column under
// both harnesses' width rules, so widths are plain character counts.
//
// Cadence: one scheduler drives two linked cadences. Every tick advances the wave by
// one quarter-cell, and every CALM_WORKING_SHIP_TICKS_PER_MOVE-th tick moves the boat
// one whole cell, so the trough stays phase-locked to a deliberately calm boat.
// Ticks, not wall-clock timestamps, drive every state change, so tests can seek time exactly.
//
// Continuity: one caller-owned sprite instance survives hide/show within one harness
// process and extension lifetime. restoreLastRendered() freezes column, direction, water
// phase, and tick cadence at the last painted frame without advancing them for hidden
// wall time, and the next working period resumes from that exact logical state. A fresh
// session or new extension lifetime calls reset() and starts at the normal initial
// position. State is never a module-level or process-global singleton.

// The asymmetric three-cell sail is centered over a five-cell hull. The one-cell
// quarter triangle keeps the left sail lighter than the full right sail, and the whole
// boat (both sail halves, mast, and hull) is one color so the sprite reads as one shape.
// The hull's inner cells retain zero-height water glyphs instead of interrupting the trough.
